# Selected work of Bingqing Huang 

## Intro
- I believe that each heart has a world of its own, separated by walls that cannot be breached by others. It is impossible to fully communicate one‘s thoughts and feelings through words alone. The most significant obstacle to connecting with others’ inner worlds is often self-defense through trauma
- However, through installation art, I can pour out all that is within me. Installation art can be a secret language, understood by those with shared experiences, encoded within the work itself.
- In my research, I have focused on using everyday objects in installations to establish a point of connection and empathy with the viewer, and to challenge myself to find ways to express the connection between the materialized outer world and my own inner world.
